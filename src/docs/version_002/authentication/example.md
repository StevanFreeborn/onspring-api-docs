# X-ApiKey Header

API Keys are specific to an instance. If you are using the API to access data from multiple instances, you will need to create an API key for each instance.

{% code heading="X-API KEY" language="text" %}

```text
X-ApiKey: 000000ffffff000000ffffff/00000000-ffff-0000-ffff-000000000000
```

{% /code %}
