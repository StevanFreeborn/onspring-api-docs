# Onspring API Docs

This is an example of what a versioned documentation site for the Onspring API might look like. It is meant to be single source of truth for the information or resources a developer might need or want when working with the Onspring API. The information documented on the site was collected from the following sources:

- [Onspring's v1 API Administrator Guide](https://software.onspring.com/hubfs/Training/Admin%20Guide%20-%20v1%20API.pdf)
- [Onspring's v2 API Administrator Guide](https://software.onspring.com/hubfs/Training/Admin%20Guide%20-%20v2%20API.pdf)
- [Onspring's v2 Swagger Documentation](https://api.onspring.com/swagger/index.html)
- Exploratory API Requests

All efforts were made to reconcile any conflicting information among these sources using actual interactions with the API as the final authoritative source.

**Note:** This is an unofficial documentation site for the Onspring API. It was not built in consultation with Onspring Technologies LLC or a member of their development team. If you are working directly with Onspring Technologies LLC while building with their API please reference their official documentation linked above.
